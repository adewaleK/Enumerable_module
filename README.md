<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Enumerable is a collection of iteration methods, a Ruby module, and a big part of what makes Ruby a great programming language. In this project, I recreated my own version of Ruby Enumerable methods:
#my_each
#my_each_with_index
#my_select
#my_all?
#my_any?
#my_none?
#my_count
#my_map
#my_inject
